# Notes Manager API - Brandon Bilinski
A Personal Project exploring API creation, PostegreSQL Internals, and Semantic embeddings.

## Project Function
This project was created to strengthen and familiarize myself with industry standard development tools. It serves as an entrypoint into a database using asynchronous methods, FastAPI, and alembic migrations. It has been dockerized as well to include the necessary Postgres extensions for semantic embedding.
